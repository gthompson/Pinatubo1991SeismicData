JOSS editors typically check:

### ✔ Clear Statement of Need  
Done.

### ✔ Functional Software  
Your modular pipeline and tests satisfy this.

### ✔ Open license  
Add `LICENSE` (MIT recommended).

### ✔ Versioned release  
After pipeline cleanup, you’ll tag `v1.0.0`.

### ✔ Archival  
Zenodo DOI at submission time.

### ✔ Tests  
Even minimal parsing tests are sufficient.

# next steps:
✅ Generate **paper.bib** (references for FIRE AND MUD, ObsPy, SeisComP, VDAP docs, etc.)  
✅ Create a **JOSS-compliant figure** (pipeline diagram)  
✅ Produce a **condensed JOSS “Software Statement of Need”** version  
✅ Prepare the Zenodo repository metadata
